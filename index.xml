      <description>The effort in REDHAWK 2.0.8 focused on:
 Core Framework
 Preventing sb.DataSink from adding an empty timestamp when it receives EOS in an empty packet. Adding inline header comments documenting C++ BulkIO input stream, output stream, and data block APIs. Fixing improperly scoped locks in Core Framework control. Implementing several C++ fixes to allow REDHAWK to compile on newer compilers. Correcting default property kinds in the DTD and XSD so they are no longer out of sync with the behavior of the Core Framework and the ICD.</description>

      <description>REDHAWK rh.TuneFilterDecimate Description Contains the source and build script for the REDHAWK rh.TuneFilterDecimate component. This component selects a narrowband cut from an input signal. Tuning, filtering and decimation are used to remove noise and interference in other frequency bands and reduce the sampling rate for more efficient downstream processing.
Installation This asset requires the rh.dsp and rh.fftlib shared libraries. These must be installed in order to build and run this asset.</description>

      <description>REDHAWK rh.autocorrelate Description Contains the source and build script for the REDHAWK rh.autocorrelate component. This component is a frequency domain implementation of a windowed autocorrelation algorithm. This algorithm works by windowing the input data to break it up into separate frames. Each frame is independently autocorrelated with each other using a &amp;quot;full&amp;quot; autocorrelation, which includes the full transient response. This is efficiently computed in the frequency domain.

      <description>REDHAWK short_file_to_float_file Description Contains the source and build script for the REDHAWK short_file_to_float_file waveform. This waveform reads in a file containing shorts, converts them to floats in REDHAWK and then writes out the file. This waveform uses three components, rh.FileReader, rh.DataConverter, and rh.FileWriter.
Installation This is a waveform project; therefore, it does not need to be built. It must be installed into the $SDRROOT/dom/waveforms directory. To install it, open the project in the REDHAWK IDE and drag it into the Target SDR folder.</description>

      <description>The effort in REDHAWK 2.0.7 focused on:
 Core Framework
 Resolving soft package dependency issue so DeviceManager resolves run time environment settings when deploying Devices and Services that have soft package dependencies. Resolving issue so that during Application release, calls to the Application object no longer result in misleading errors. Improving flexibility to ignore GPP threshold checks when determining if the GPP should go into a BUSY state. Resolving issue where processes with spaces in the names would cause the GPP to terminate.</description>

      <description>The effort in REDHAWK 2.2.1 focused on:
 Improving how the MessageSupplier port&amp;rsquo;s sendMessages() method handles bulk message failures when the size exceeds the maximum CORBA transfer size. On failure, messages are now sent individually. Fixing the Octet output format for the bluefile FileSink. Changing the output for the &amp;ldquo;number of samples pushed&amp;rdquo; when data for a BulkIO stream is generated spanning multiple timestamps. The output changed from being the &amp;ldquo;number of samples spanning the timestamp packets&amp;rdquo; to being the &amp;ldquo;number of samples that was requested&amp;rdquo;.</description>
