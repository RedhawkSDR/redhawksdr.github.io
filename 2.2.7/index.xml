      <description>The REDHAWK IDE provides a tool for auto-generating component code for C++, Python, or Java languages. This process takes care of REDHAWK compliance and allows the developer to insert their own custom processing algorithm for working with the data sent/received by the component. The following section provides a brief description of the generated files. Note that some files may be freely modified, while other files should not be modified.</description>

      <guid>https://redhawksdr.github.io/2.2.7/manual/connections/burstio/data-transfers/</guid>
      <description>Burst Input/Output (BurstIO) data transfers happen through the pushBurst() and pushBursts() method calls of a REDHAWK resource’s (component or device) BurstIO port object. A resource can use these push methods to transfer bursts and their associated meta data from one resource to another within the resource’s service function. Similar to Bulk Input/Output (BulkIO), BurstIO interfaces provide the same BULKIO::PrecisionUTCTime time stamp for each data vector of the burst. BurstIO defines a new BurstSRI Signal Related Information (SRI) object that enables developers to further describe the signaling environment and the data transformations.</description>

      <guid>https://redhawksdr.github.io/2.2.7/manual/logging/logging-structure/</guid>
      <description>Java logging is based on log4j, and C++ logging is based on log4cxx, a C++ mapping of the log4j API. Python logging is based on log4py, a Python mapping between the Python loggers and log4j configuration files developed for REDHAWK. These three logging technologies were selected because they all follow the same structure, and they can all be configured using the same configuration files.
Loggers provide the ability to associate a particular logger identifier by its string name with one or more appenders (for example, standard out) and a log level (for example, TRACE).</description>

      <guid>https://redhawksdr.github.io/2.2.7/getting-started/process-management/</guid>
      <description>This chapter addresses the basic level of decomposition and deployment for REDHAWK and the middleware used to support communications between basic functional units.
Process Management The basic functional unit in REDHAWK is a component, which represents a single process on a host computer. The component supports the interfaces necessary to initialize, configure, query, test, connect to other components, and terminate the component. It also manages a processing thread which contains the component’s functionality and the buffering of input/output data.</description>

      <guid>https://redhawksdr.github.io/2.2.7/manual/connections/bulkio/stream-api/</guid>
      <description>The Bulk Input/Output (BulkIO) stream API provides a high-level interface to sending and receiving data via BulkIO ports. Each stream is tied to a port, and encapsulates both the Signal Related Information (SRI) and the data associated with it. For more information, refer to the Shared Address information in the Technical Notes and the BulkIO header files.
Streams are automatically managed by the port that creates them. User code does not own the stream itself; instead, user instances are opaque stream handles.</description>

      <guid>https://redhawksdr.github.io/2.2.7/manual/connections/the-connection-process/</guid>
      <description>All connections take a client-server pattern. All calls are made from the client to the server. It is the role of the server to provide a set of functions that can be called by the client. It is the role of the client to understand what interfaces the server provides and to invoke (use) them. This is the basis for the uses/provides nomenclature for ports.
All uses ports implement the CF::Port interface.</description>

      <description>The following sections further describe the definition of the waveform as well as its creation and manipulation within the IDE. Like the Properties File (PRF), Software Component Descriptor (SCD), and Software Package Descriptor (SPD) XML files of a component, a waveform is completely represented by its Software Assembly Descriptor (SAD) file (*.sad.xml). The REDHAWK IDE provides a means of modifying the XML files without the need to directly edit this file by hand.</description>

      <guid>https://redhawksdr.github.io/2.2.7/manual/devices/associating-a-waveform/</guid>
      <description>Two processes can be used to associate a waveform with an FrontEnd Interfaces (FEI) device:
 Write code that creates an allocation and creates the connection between the allocated device and the waveform or component that is to receive or produce the data. Create a usesdevice relationship artifact in the waveform.  The benefit of creating a usesdevice relationship artifact is that the deployment of the waveform can be tied to the availability of hardware resources.</description>

      <guid>https://redhawksdr.github.io/2.2.7/manual/logging/configuring-logging-capabilities/</guid>
      <description>A logger is configured through two mechanisms: a log configuration file and a global log level.
The log configuration file enables users to manage appenders and configure the settings for individual loggers. The global log level is a shortcut that allows users to set the log level for an entire resource with a single call or command-line switch. When a configuraton file and log level are used together, the configuration file describes the settings for appenders and named loggers, while the log level is applied to the resource&amp;rsquo;s main logger.</description>

      <description>In this section, an overview of the structure of a component is presented.
Component Wizard In the REDHAWK IDE, development of new components, devices, or other artifacts in a REDHAWK environment is contained within an Eclipse project. Each REDHAWK-specific artifact is associated with a wizard that leads the developer through the steps necessary to create a project, which supports the minimum required pieces for proper functioning. For components, the default project settings allow the developer to choose between Python, C++, and Java as the development language.</description>

      <guid>https://redhawksdr.github.io/2.2.7/manual/nodes/creating-a-new-node/</guid>
      <description>As shown in Exploring the Running Node a node is a Device Manager instance with an associated set of devices and services. A node is completely defined by a Device Configuration Descriptor (DCD) XML file. A Device Manager uses the information in this XML file to deploy, configure, and inter-connect devices and services.
The REDHAWK Node Project in the REDHAWK IDE provides a mechanism for generating these DCD files. By invoking the REDHAWK Node Project, a wizard is started where the developer selects different characteristics for the node like the project name.</description>

      <description>The Domain Manager is in charge of the control and configuration of the entire systems domain.
Its primary responsibilities can be grouped into three main categories:
 Registration Core Framework (CF) administration Human Computer Interfacing  Each domain has a single Domain Manager that keeps track of a File Manager, a set of Device Managers, and a set of Application Factories. The Domain Manager maintains information on all aspects of the waveform’s implementations contained within its system.</description>

      <description>The File System interface defines CORBA operations that exists to provide a runtime abstraction of an OS&amp;rsquo; real file system. It gives REDHAWK the ability to have a single interface for reading and writing individual files within a file system regardless of the underlying implementation in the OS.
Files that are stored on the File System may be either plain files or directories.
Characters and symbols that are valid in directories and file names consist of:</description>

      <description>Installation Installation of the REDHAWK Core Framework and IDE is handled through a set of RPMs. The use of RPMs allows for automated installation of dependencies required for REDHAWK to run as well as automated installation of the Core Framework and IDE. Greater detail on REDHAWK installation can be found in the REDHAWK manual.
Basic Example The fastest and easiest way to get a REDHAWK application started is through the REDHAWK sandbox, a self contained Python module that is able to run REDHAWK components outside the runtime environment, which limits the components to a single host computer.</description>

      <description>The Python package contains helpers that simplify the allocation/deallocation of FrontEnd Interfaces (FEI) tuners. For example, to allocate a tuner to receive, centered at 1 MHz with a bandwidth of 1kHz, a 10% tolerance in the requested values, and a sample rate of 2 kHz, the following functionality can be used:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import frontend &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; allocation = frontend.createTunerAllocation(tuner_type=&amp;#34;RX&amp;#34;, allocation_id=&amp;#34;someid&amp;#34;,center_frequency=1e6, bandwidth=1e3,bandwidth_tolerance=0.1, sample_rate=2e3,sample_rate_tolerance=0.1) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; retval = dev.allocateCapacity(allocation) where dev is a reference to the device object and retval is True if the allocation succeeded.</description>

      <guid>https://redhawksdr.github.io/2.2.7/manual/connections/why-ports/</guid>
      <description>It seems burdensome to connect components through port objects; this is an additional level of indirection that adds another layer of complexity. This approach is taken largely because it allows modularization of interfaces when components have more than one input or output port.</description>

      <description>Attachable streams provide a way to use out-of-band data transfer. The mechanics of the data transfer are defined by a separate network protocol, while REDHAWK provides connection management. The two supported attachable streams for Bulk Input/Output (BulkIO) are SDDS and VITA49. The BulkIO uses port passes a StreamDefinition object to the connected ports using the attach method. The connected input port provides the StreamDefinition object for the downstream resource to create a connection to the actual data source.</description>

      <guid>https://redhawksdr.github.io/2.2.7/manual/sandbox/python/helpers/</guid>
      <description>The Python sandbox provides a variety of helpers to both simplify the interaction with REDHAWK subsystems as well as increase the reliability of interactions with these subsystems.
A common problem is type matching in properties. While Python is very flexible with types, other languages, like C++ and Java, are not. When properties are set on components, the type for the value has to match the type that is expected by the component.</description>

      <guid>https://redhawksdr.github.io/2.2.7/manual/connections/bulkio/data-transfers/</guid>
      <description>It is strongly recommended that for BulkIO data in C++ and Python, you use the Bulk Input/Output (BulkIO) stream API, which provides a high-level interface to sending and receiving data via BulkIO ports. For more information, refer to Stream API and the Shared Address information in the Technical Notes.
 Data transfers happen through the pushPacket() method call of a REDHAWK component’s port object. This method transfers the data from the uses-side port to the corresponding connected provides-side port.</description>

      <description>This section provides an overview of members available to the component class. There are four kinds of members: ports, properties, domain awareness, and network interface.
Ports Data flow into and out of components is accomplished through the use of ports. Ports are described as being either a provides (input) or uses (output) port. This naming convention is often viewed as counter-intuitive, so an explanation is in order. Ports are RPC interfaces to a component.</description>

      <description>REDHAWK provides the ability to auto-generate a REDHAWK component given an Octave M function. Assuming M functions are set up to input/output data vectors rather than relying on file or terminal-based input/output, these components are seamlessly deployable on runtime systems.
Octave version 3.4 or greater, with development support, must be installed on the development and deployment systems. This requirement can be met by either installing Octave from source or installing the octave-devel RPM.</description>

      <description>Devices in the sandbox support all of the features of components, plus additional features specific to devices. A sandbox device instance always supports the base CF::Device allocation and deallocation interfaces. If the device supports the CF::LoadableDevice, CF::ExecutableDevice or CF::AggregateDevice interfaces, the methods for those interfaces are also available.
Capacity Allocation The sandbox provides a simplified interface for capacity allocation and deallocation. The allocateCapacity() and deallocateCapacity() methods can take a Python dictionary of allocation property names and values.</description>

      <description>Dependencies A component can be described as consuming an arbitrary amount of capacity from a device; this relationship is called a dependency. Dependencies are generalized, so it is possible to create a dependency based on attributes (property of kind allocation) of devices irrespective of the specific nature of a device.
A dependency is defined by how much of a particular device resource is required. For example, a component dependency could be a requirement of 1.</description>

      <guid>https://redhawksdr.github.io/2.2.7/manual/appendices/adminservice/configuration/domainmanager/</guid>
      <description>Each REDHAWK Domain Manager service is controlled by a file in the /etc/redhawk/domains.d directory. The AdminService provides the initial values for the configuration parameters of a service. Any values in the /etc/redhawk/init.d/domain.defaults file override the initial configuration. Finally, the values in the INI file override any configuration (defined internally or specified in the /etc/redhawk/init.d/domain.defaults file).
rhadmin can generate an example Domain Manager configuration file with the complete set of parameters that can be used to the control the setup and execution of a REDHAWK Domain Manager service.</description>

      <description>A port belongs to a component or device (devices are specialized components - see Working With Devices for additional information). To retrieve a port, an external entity needs to call getPort() on the component that owns that port. The argument to the getPort() function is the string name for the port, and the return value is a CORBA pointer to that port object. Both uses and provides ports are retrieved from components through this function call.</description>

      <description>The Eclipse introductory screen displays a Workbench button that takes the user to the IDE’s development environment: the workbench. The workbench is made up of multiple, smaller windows, which are referred to as views in the Eclipse context.
At the center of the IDE workbench is the editor window, which is empty at initial startup. The editor is the primary window used when developing code within the REDHAWK IDE. An Eclipse editor is a context-sensitive window within the workbench; the language of opened files dictates the type of editor that is opened, impacting editing features such as syntax highlighting.</description>

      <description>The sandbox runs components without needing a device proxy; it forks the component process and manages its lifecycle. When running in a domain, however, the deployment of components in an application requires the domain to search for available host computers that can run the components in the application. The search requires each host computer to have a program that can publicize the host computer’s capabilities (for example, operating system, processor type, or available memory).</description>

      <description>Components are processes that run on a computer. As such, each component takes up some arbitrary, often time-varying amount of spare capacity (for example, CPU computing load, memory, network I/O). REDHAWK manages computing resources on every computer under its domain to minimize the likelihood that computing resources are over-subscribed. Each computer under REDHAWK’s domain is managed through the GPP process.
GPP Device The GPP device is a specialized REDHAWK device that manages the deployment of components onto the computer and can be inspected like any other REDHAWK device.</description>

      <description>Each BurstPacket of the incoming data provides the getComplex() method to denote if the vector contains complex samples (It is comprised of real and imaginary parts.) Complex data is sent as alternating real and imaginary values. A developer can work with this data in any fashion; however, this section describes the common methods for converting the data into a more workable form.
Converting Complex Data in C++ In C++, the incoming Burst Input/Output (BurstIO) data vector may be typecast into a std::vector of complex values.</description>

      <description>In REDHAWK 2.2.0 and above, Bulk Input/Output (BulkIO) includes a packed bit data format, BULKIO::dataBit. The transfer of packed bit data between processing stages is standardized, including the ability to transfer a non-byte aligned number of bits.
General REDHAWK manages bits as arrays of bytes, with each byte containing up to 8 consecutive bits. Bit indices start with the most significant bit: bit index 0 is the most significant bit of the first byte, bit index 1 is the second most significant bit, and so on.</description>

      <description>Applications are software objects representing waveforms. They are used to organize a group of components that are linked together to accomplish a useful computational task. Applications provide a convenient way to move data around in order to achieve these different tasks by allowing for components to easily be interchanged.
Application Class Each application contains a unique application name and profile, which describes the application’s configuration. This profile is a Software Assembly Descriptor (SAD) file that is referenced by a File Manager.</description>

      <description>Building the Framework This section describes how to build and install REDHAWK from source and use the environment variables to run REDHAWK.
Installing Build Dependencies Building REDHAWK from source requires a few additional dependencies beyond those required to run REDHAWK. The following procedure explains how to install the additional build dependencies.
 First, ensure your system has the necessary dependency software provided by RHEL / CentOS and Fedora EPEL. Ensure the REDHAWK Yum repository is set up using the process described in Setting Up the REDHAWK Repostiory.</description>

      <guid>https://redhawksdr.github.io/2.2.7/manual/component-structure/component-implementations/</guid>
      <description>Components may specify particular dependencies such as OS, processor architecture, or required device properties (e.g., processor speed or memory capacity). Setting these dependencies ensures that a component is deployed to an appropriate device at runtime.
While REDHAWK supports multiple implementations for a single component, it can be confusing, especially when debugging a system. Except for some limited scenarios, it is recommended that developers associate a single implementation with each component.</description>

      <guid>https://redhawksdr.github.io/2.2.7/manual/appendices/adminservice/configuration/devicemanager/</guid>
      <description>Each REDHAWK Device Manager service is controlled by a file in the /etc/redhawk/nodes.d directory. The AdminService provides the initial values for the configuration parameters of a service. Any values in the /etc/redhawk/init.d/node.defaults file override the initial configuration. Finally, the values in the INI file override any configuration (defined internally or specified in the /etc/redhawk/init.d/node.defaults file).
Although there are no rules on partitioning nodes for a REDHAWK system, it is recommended that you do not define more than one GPP per computing host.</description>

      <description>Unless a component is in the process of being terminated, it is valid to retrieve a port reference at any other point in the component’s life cycle. Anyone may call getPort() on the component at any time. In the case of a uses port, anyone may call connectPort() or disconnectPort() at any time. In the case of a provides port, anyone may cast to that port reference and start making calls on it.</description>

      <description>Every resource capable of hosting custom logging (component, device, service) includes the class member _baseLog. The _baseLog member is a logger instance that has the same logging name as the resource instance. For example, the first instance of comp in a waveform is comp_1. For logging within a REDHAWK resource, _baseLog is the resource&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;root&amp;rdquo; logger. The log4j root logger still exists and is the parent for the resource&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;root&amp;rdquo; logger.</description>

      <description>This section explains how to manage REDHAWK core services either by domain or by type (domain, nodes, or waveforms). For additional information on managing service configurations and life cycle management, refer to Domain Manager Service, Device Manager Service, and Waveform Service.
Managing Services for a Domain Services for a domain can be managed using the following commands.
 Reloading and restarting all services for a domain from current configuration files:  rhadmin update &amp;lt;Domain Name&amp;gt;  Starting all services in a domain:  rhadmin start &amp;lt;Domain Name&amp;gt;  Stopping all the services in a domain:  rhadmin stop &amp;lt;Domain Name&amp;gt;  Inspecting the status of all the services in a domain:  rhadmin status &amp;lt;Domain Name&amp;gt;  Running a custom status script for all the services in a domain and displaying the script output:  rhadmin query &amp;lt;Domain Name&amp;gt;  Restarting all the services for a domain:  rhadmin restart &amp;lt;Domain Name&amp;gt; Managing Services by Type Each life cycle management command (start, stop, status, query, and restart) has an optional type parameter (domain, nodes, and waveforms), which restricts the command to execute against the specific type of service for a domain.</description>

      <description>The REDHAWK IDE contains the ability to plot using the NeXtMidas plotting framework. If the output port uses the Bulk Input/Output (BulkIO) interface, it can take advantage of this feature and plot a line graph or a falling raster.
To bring up a plot within the IDE:
 Make sure that the component is currently in the started state.
 Right-click the desired port to plot.
 Select either Plot Port Data or Plot Port FFT.</description>

      <guid>https://redhawksdr.github.io/2.2.7/manual/components/running-a-component/</guid>
      <description>To run a component, use one of the following mechanisms: the REDHAWK sandbox or the REDHAWK domain. When using the sandbox, a component is run from within a Python shell or a graphical environment, all operating on a single computer. When using the domain, a component is run in the context of an application that can be deployed over an arbitrarily large number of computers. The sandbox is useful for tasks such as signal processing development and analysis, component debugging, and data inspection.</description>

      <guid>https://redhawksdr.github.io/2.2.7/manual/connections/bulkio/working-with-complex-data/</guid>
      <description>If the StreamSRI mode field of the incoming data is set to 1, the associated input data is complex (i.e., it is composed of real and imaginary parts). Complex data is sent as alternating real and imaginary values. A developer can work with this data in any fashion; however, this section provides common methods for converting the data into a more workable form.
Converting Complex Data in C++ In C++, the incoming Bulk Input/Output (BulkIO) data block provides a complex() method to check whether the data is complex, and a cxbuffer() method to reinterpret the sample data as a redhawk::shared_buffer of std::complex values.</description>

      <description>As a system framework, REDHAWK is affected by system settings beyond the scope of REDHAWK. System optimization is sensitive to the set of applications that the system is intended to support. However, there are some simple settings that can apply to a wide set of applications. This chapter describes some of the effects of these generalized settings.
Configuring omniORB By default, omniORB configuration relies on the loopback interface of the operating system.</description>

      <description>All Burst Input/Output (BurstIO) ports support the Bulk Input/Output (BulkIO) statistics interface with additional keywords to track burst-specific metrics. Statistics are tracked over a window of 10 pushBurst calls. An input port contains a single PortStatistics structure, whereas, an output port contains a sequence of PortStatistics structures; one structure per connection. For more information on BULKIO::PortStatistics, see Port Statistics. The additional BurstIO metrics for both input and output ports are described in the following tables:</description>

      <description>Data flow between REDHAWK resources (components and devices) is managed through two sets of interfaces: Bulk Input/Output (BulkIO) and Burst Input/Output (BurstIO). The BulkIO module is designed for streaming data and maximizes the efficiency for bulk data transfers between resources, whereas, BurstIO is designed for applications that require small and possibly non-contiguous chunks of data transfers. Both interfaces also allow for the association of metadata, Signal Related Information (SRI), and a Precision Time Stamp, which describe the content being transferred in support of content processing.</description>

      <description>The Application Factory is responsible for the creation of applications within a domain. Whenever an application is installed by the Domain Manager, an Application Factory is created from tags in the application’s Software Assembly Descriptor (SAD) file, in order to deploy components of the application to devices based on their implementation dependencies.
When the create() function is called, the Application Factory uses the Software Package Descriptor (SPD) implementation element to locate devices that are capable of loading and executing the given component.</description>

      <description>REDHAWK waveforms are controlled by files in the /etc/redhawk/waveforms.d directory. The AdminService provides the initial values for the configuration parameters of a service. Any values in the /etc/redhawk/init.d/waveform.defaults file override the initial configuration. Finally, the values in the INI file override any configuration (defined internally or specified in the /etc/redhawk/init.d/waveform.defaults file). To define multiple waveform instances in one file, add multiple sections.
The waveform can be configured to start after the Device Manager has started up; it can also optionally wait a configurable amount of time for the domain to be available before attempting to start an instance of the waveform.</description>

      <description>The Device Manager interface is used to manage a set of logical devices, services and a File System. The Device Manager is responsible for parsing the node&amp;rsquo;s Device Configuration Descriptor (DCD) XML in order to fork processes for all devices and services in the node. Each process gets passed a list of command-line character strings as executable parameters that are node-specific configuration variables read from the dcd.xml file.
Once a child process has been forked, its reference is added to a pending list in the Device Manager, while the child process is initialized and configured (possibly with overloaded property values).</description>

      <guid>https://redhawksdr.github.io/2.2.7/manual/appendices/persona-device-pattern/</guid>
      <description>In REDHAWK, you can manage and maintain the lifecycle of programmable hardware, such as FPGAs, by implementing a specific design pattern: the Persona Pattern. This design pattern is rooted heavily in the concept of REDHAWK devices, proxies used to interface physical hardware with the REDHAWK Framework.
To accurately represent the dynamic nature of programmable hardware, two unique roles have been established: the programmable role and the persona role. These roles are represented in REDHAWK as two separate REDHAWK devices: programmable devices and persona devices.</description>

      <description>The Allocation Manager provides a single point for creating, inspecting, and delegating allocations.
Using the Allocation Manager Performing an allocation is more than just allocating against a device; the allocation process involves searching for a device that will satisfy the allocation, making the allocation itself, and then storing the allocation such that it can be deallocated at some later arbitrary time. The Domain Manager uses the Allocation Manager to resolve allocations during application deployment.</description>

      <description>In addition to using message event properties and message ports, the REDHAWK library enables developers to interface with event channels to send and receive non-REDHAWK structured messages using the CORBA Any object. The library provides both publisher and subscriber interfaces for sending and receiving data. The libraries make use of existing marshaling and unmarshaling support for simple data types (i.e., int, float, string, etc.), REDHAWK Core Framework (CF) event messages, and defined structured messages used by your component.</description>

      <guid>https://redhawksdr.github.io/2.2.7/manual/appendices/shared-memory/</guid>
      <description>REDHAWK uses POSIX shared memory to provide optimized data transfer for Bulk Input/Output (BulkIO) connections between C++ components or devices on the same host. On Linux systems, POSIX shared memory is visible as a filesystem of type tmpfs mounted at /dev/shm. Files on this filesystem are backed by RAM and are not written to disk.
The shared memory used by REDHAWK is organized into heaps, one per process, that exist as files in /dev/shm.</description>

      <description>Within a component, many of the Uses port classes in REDHAWK support notification when a connection is made or broken. The supported port types and syntax vary by language.
C++ In C++, the connection notification mechanism is standardized for Bulk Input/Output (BulkIO), Burst Input/Output (BurstIO), and Messaging Uses ports in C++. Connect and disconnect callbacks are registered with the port.
The following examples assume a C++ component with a BulkIO float output port, dataFloat_out; however, the syntax is the same for BurstIO and Message ports.</description>

      <guid>https://redhawksdr.github.io/2.2.7/manual/runtime-environment/events/</guid>
      <description>Events are heavily leveraged by REDHAWK to provide system awareness and exchange both synchronous and asynchronous data. This chapter describes the mechanics of creating and consuming events as well as standard event types defined in REDHAWK and how they are used. The methodology used to exchange synchronous and asynchronous data, although reliant on events as the communications mechanism, is discussed in Messaging.
Event Definition CORBA defines an interface for the transport of events as well as an interface for the creation of event channels that can support a publish/subscribe pattern; within REDHAWK, publishers are often described as producers, and subscribers are often described as consumers.</description>

      <description>REDHAWK provides Front End Interfaces (FEI) and standard Core Framework (CF) interfaces (like CF::Resource) to control entities and promote interoperability. There are some use cases where you may find the need to use custom Interface Description Language (IDL) to control entities. For these use cases, you can create custom IDL projects in the IDE.
Adding ports from either the FEI interface or a custom IDL interface to a component or device allows that entity to control other entities through CORBA.</description>
